This directory contains three pdf files, `report.pdf` this is the full thesis, `summary.pdf` a thousand-word summary for the project, and finally `methodology.pdf`, this should not be take into account for marking, I decided to add it as an extensive appendix, due to word limits, I could not fit everything in the main report. Here we have propagation of error and a detailed explanation of HMC sampling algorithms.
