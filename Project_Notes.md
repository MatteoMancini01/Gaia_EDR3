### Project General Objective
The objective of this project is to use Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3), to determine symmetric pattern of the solar system barycentre 
w.r.t. the rest of the Universe, this is done by measuring the proper motion of QSO-like objects. 
These objects are extremely far from us, making QSO-like objects appropriate reference rest frames. Hence the proper motion that we observe 
from data, is the solar system moving w.r.t. QSO-like object. 

### What are QSO-like objects?
QSO stands for quasi-stellar object also known as quasars. A quasar is an extremely luminous active galactic nucleus (ANG). At the centre 
of every galaxy lies a super massive black hole, with mass ranging from millions to tens of billions of solar masses. The accretion disk is 
the structure formed of diffuse material in orbital motion around the black hole. Due to the black hole immense gravitational force, the material 
that compose the accretion disk (typically gasses), spirals inward while being compressed and heated to extreme temperature due to friction, 
generating enormous amount of radiation predominantly in the optical, ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths.   

### What is aberration?
The aberration of light is an apparent shift in the position of a celestial object caused by the motion of the observer relative to the source 
of light. It is a relativistic effect, resulting from the finite speed of light and the motion of the observer.

### What is VSH (vector spherical harmonics)?
Mathematically, vector spherical harmonics are an extension of spherical harmonics (mathematical functions defined on the surface of a sphere) 
with the addition of vector fields. Complex-valued functions are the components of VSH, these are expressed as spherical coordinate basis vectors. 
For the purposes of this project, VSH will be used as the model distribution to fit the data from Gaia ERD3.

### What is the Gaia mission?
Gaia is a space observatory launched in 2013 by the European Space Agency (ESA). 
The spacecraft is designed to collect data from space in particular, measurements of positions, distances and motion of stars. 
We aim to construct the largest 3D space catalog ever made, containing approximately over 1 billion astronomical objects, also including planets, 
comets, asteroids and quasars (these are vital for the project purpose).

### What is VLBI?
Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a type of astronomical interferometry used in used in radio astronomy. 
This is also used to collect data on quasars, the main difference to Gaia is that VLBI works in the radio wavelength 
and has been historically used to define the celestial reference frame. While Gaia, on the other hand, 
operates in optical wavelengths and has defined the Gaia Celestial Reference Frame (Gaia-CRF), complementing the ICRF.
