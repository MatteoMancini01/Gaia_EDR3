### Project General Objective
The objective of this project is to use Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3), to determine symmetric pattern of the solar system barycentre w.r.t. the rest of the Universe, this is done by measuring the proper motion of QSO-like objects. These objects are extremely far from us, making QSO-like objects appropriate reference rest frames. Hence the proper motion that we observe from data, is the solar system moving w.r.t. QSO-like object. 

### What are QSO-like objects?

### What is a quasar?

### What is aberration?

### What is VSH (vector spherical harmonics)?

### What is the Gaia mission?

### What is VLBI?
