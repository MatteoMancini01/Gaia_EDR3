# Key Definitions \& Project Objectives
---
### Project General Objective
The objective of this project is to use Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3), to determine symmetric pattern of the solar system barycentre 
w.r.t. the rest of the Universe, this is done by measuring the proper motion of QSO-like objects. 
These objects are extremely far from us, making QSO-like objects appropriate reference rest frames. Hence the proper motion that we observe 
from data, is the solar system moving w.r.t. QSO-like object. 

### What are QSO-like objects?
A <b>Quasi-Stellar Object</b> (QSO), commonly known as a quasar, is an extremely luminous <b>Active Galactic Nucleus</b> (AGN). Most massive galaxies are believed to host a supermassive black hole at their center, with masses ranging from millions to tens of billions of solar masses. An <b>accretion disk</b> forms from gas and dust spiraling toward the black hole, heated by intense viscous and magnetic processes, emitting enormous amounts of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths.   

### What is aberration?
The aberration of light is an apparent shift in the position of a celestial object caused by the motion of the observer relative to the source 
of light. It is a relativistic effect, resulting from the finite speed of light and the motion of the observer.

### What is VSH (vector spherical harmonics)?
Mathematically, vector spherical harmonics are an extension of spherical harmonics (mathematical functions defined on the surface of a sphere) 
with the addition of vector fields. Complex-valued functions are the components of VSH, these are expressed as spherical coordinate basis vectors. 
For the purposes of this project, VSH will be used as the model distribution to fit the data from Gaia ERD3.

### What is the Gaia mission?
Gaia is a space observatory launched in 2013 by the European Space Agency (ESA). 
The spacecraft is designed to collect data from space in particular, measurements of positions, distances and motion of stars. 
We aim to construct the largest 3D space catalog ever made, containing approximately over 1 billion astronomical objects, also including planets, 
comets, asteroids and quasars (these are vital for the project purpose).

### What is VLBI?
Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a type of astronomical interferometry used in used in radio astronomy. 
This is also used to collect data on quasars, the main difference to Gaia is that VLBI works in the radio wavelength 
and has been historically used to define the celestial reference frame. While Gaia, on the other hand, 
operates in optical wavelengths and has defined the Gaia Celestial Reference Frame (Gaia-CRF), complementing the ICRF.

### Baryons

Baryons are particles like protons and neutrons. A baryonic component refers to the part of a system, such as galaxies, galactic clusters or the universe itself, that is made of  baryonic matter. Examples include, starts, gas, dust, planets, including black holes and neutron stars if they are from baryonic matter. Essentially, it includes all the "normal" matter we are familiar with.

# Project Log

This section aims to keep track of the progress made with the project. I will report all the updates made before pushing to the remote repository. This aims to facilitate writing the report once the project is completed.

### Download Data

Follow the instructions presented in the section [Download Data](README.md#downloading-data-ringed_planet-telescope-floppy_disk) from the [README.md](README.md) file. 

<b>How it works!</b>

- Import the required libraries, namely, `astroquery.gaia` (a package to query the Gaia archive) and `pandas` (to help manipulate and view data).
- Write the SQL query:
   ```bash
      query = """
      SELECT 
         agn.source_id, 
         gs.ra, gs.dec, 
         gs.pmra, gs.pmdec, 
         gs.parallax, gs.parallax_error, 
         gs.ruwe, gs.phot_g_mean_mag,
         gs.nu_eff_used_in_astrometry,
         gs.pmra_error,
         gs.pmdec_error,
         gs.pmra_pmdec_corr,
         gs.astrometric_params_solved
      FROM gaiadr3.agn_cross_id AS agn
      JOIN gaiadr3.gaia_source AS gs 
      ON agn.source_id = gs.source_id
      """
   ```
   this defines a query that:
   - Joins Gaia's AGN cross-match table (`agn_cross_id`) with the main Gaia source catalog (`gaia_source`) using the common `source_is`.
   - Selects important astrometric properties: RA, Dec, proper motions, parallax, errors, photometric magnitude, RUWE, and atrometric parameters.

- Once this is ready we launch the query asynchronously:
   ```bash

      job = Gaia.launch_job_async(query)
      result = job.get_results()

   ```
   This sends the query to Gaia archive sercer, through `launch_job_async()`, asynchronously. This means that the program is not blocked while waiting. And downloads the table of results when the query finishes, with `get_results()`

- In the final step we save the results into a CSV file in the repository, so that one can load the data whenever it's required. Results are saved using `result.write("qso_full_data.csv", format="csv", overwrite=True)`, this also overwrite on the saved file `qso_full_data.csv` in case we need to redownload the data.

<b>Data Structure</b>

1. <b>source_id</b>, Unique Gaia identifier for the object
2. <b>ra</b>, Right Ascension (celestial longitude) in degrees
3. <b>dec</b>, Declination (celestial latitude) in degrees
4. <b>pmra</b>, Proper motion in Right Ascension (mas/yr)
5. <b>pmdec</b>, Proper motion in Declination (mas/yr)
6. <b>parallax</b>, Parallax measurament (this is expected to be near zero for distant QSOs)
7. <b>ruwe</b>, Renormalised Unit Weight Error (this indicates the quality of the data point)
8. <b>phot_g_mean_mag</b>, Mean magnitude in Gaia's G-band 
9. <b>nu_eff_used_in_astrometry</b>, Efficient wavenumber denoted as $\nu_{eff}$, this is used to charecterise the color of a celestial object by describing how its light is distributed across different wavelenghts.
10. <b>parallax_error</b>, measure the uncentainty on parralax (standard deviation).
11. <b>pmra_error</b>, Uncertainty in pmra.
12. <b>pmdec_error</b>, Uncertainty in pmdec_error.

<b>Visualisation</b>

We decided to plot the data in 6 different histograms, three for each 5 and 6 parameter solutions. This was done by dividing the original data frame into `df_5param` and `df_6param`, to differentiate the two, we set `astomeric_params_solved` to 31 and 95 respectively. In binary 31 = 11111 and 95 = 1011111, different bits (1s and 0s) mean different things, and Gaia internally uses these codes to label how many parameters were solved for. Thus, we can filter by how many and which astrometric parameters Gaia fit fir that object.
For the 5 parameter solutions we plotted histograms for the following parameters:
-	Efficient wavenumber 
-	Mean magnitude in Gaiaâ€™s G-band 
-	RUWE 

For the 6 parameter solutions:
-	Normalised parallaxes
-	Normalised pmra
-	Normalised pmdec

Plotting histograms is not only useful to visualise the distribution of each of those parameters, but also serves as a benchmark for comparing our plots to the plots in Gaia Early Data Release 3: Acceleration of the Solar System from Gaia astrometry, Klioner, S. A., et al. 2021.
